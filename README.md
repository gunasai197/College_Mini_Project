# HandGesture-based-Food-Ordering-System
The hand gesture-based food ordering system addresses
several critical issues in the realm of dining and customer
service. First, it tackles the challenge of language barriers
and communication difficulties between customers and
restaurant staff, which can often lead to order inaccuracies
and misunderstandings. By enabling customers to place
orders using intuitive hand gestures, the system eliminates
the need for verbal communication, ensuring accurate and
seamless transactions
      
Secondly, the system enhances accessibility for
individuals with speech impairments or those who may face
challenges in verbally communicating their orders. This
inclusivity ensures that all patrons can quickly and
confidently place their orders without relying on external
assistance.

- Decision Tree
# Let's look at a step-by-step guide on how to exeute this project
Here's a list of required installations and libraries:

1. **Python**:
   - You're using Python scripts, so Python needs to be installed on your system.

2. **Flask**:
   - Your server is built using Flask.
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

3. **Flask-SocketIO**:
   - To handle real-time communication between the server and client.
   ```bash
   pip install Flask-SocketIO
   ```

4. **OpenCV (cv2)**:
   - For image and video processing.
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

5. **MediaPipe**:
   - We are using MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
   ```bash
   pip install mediapipe
   ```

6. **Socket.io JavaScript Client**:
   - This will be included in the frontend to facilitate real-time communication. We're including it from a CDN in the HTML.

7. **Joblib**:
   - For loading saved machine learning models.
   ```bash
   pip install joblib
   ```

8. **TensorFlow or Keras**:
   - We're loading a model (`load_model`). Depending on how this function is defined, it likely requires TensorFlow or Keras. 
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   ```

9. **Numpy**:
   - Often used with OpenCV and other numerical operations.
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

10. **Werkzeug**:
   - Werkzeug is used internally by Flask, but you might need to install it explicitly if using specific features.
   ```bash
   pip install Werkzeug
   ```

11. **Web Browser**:
   - To view the web interface of your application.


Lastly, remember to regularly update your libraries to get bug fixes and improvements, but also be cautious about compatibility issues when updating.
